title: Context Standards
---

Demisto organizes incident data in a tree of objects called the *Incident Context*. Any integration commands or scripts that run, will add data into the context at a predefined location. This also applies to commands that run within playbook execution.

When building new integrations the entry context should be returned according to this standard. 

If there is no matching item in the standard, reach out to the architect team to check if your addition merits an update or change of the standard. 

If the data is vendor/tool specific, it can be assigned its own context path.

Below are examples of how each entity should be formed in the entry context.
